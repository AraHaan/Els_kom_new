    + Fixed about window issue from the main window able to cover the about
        window up.
    + Added INI's now down to 1 file instead of 6.
    + Added ability to see if the INI exists or not.
    + Might add ability to test mods out but whenever the game updates you must
        make a backup of your unpacked copy before packing as packing removes
        them.
