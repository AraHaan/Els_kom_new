    + Fixed the crash when packing in 1.3.0.15 it was a mistake I made in the
        original code that I didn't notice till then.
    + Made Els_kom require Admin so that some of its functions work correctly
        to clean Python 2.7.1's folder of unneeded files created from
        packing/unpacking.
