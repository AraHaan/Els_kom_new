Found an higher resolution Els_kom icon of size 128 x 128 on the Original Els_kom made in Delphi that does not work anymore and added it to my icon for my current Els_kom. I will investigate how to decompile the Delphi source code. I did decompile the Delphi Form already without it's actual code that is how I got the better icon.
