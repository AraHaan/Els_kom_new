Add interface for plugins early. While trying to implement the packers/unpackers in the Core and have plugins for Algorithm 2 & 3 I realized it would be better for plugins to do all the packing and unpacking themselves. But will still look into loading plugins for Algorithm 2 & 3 and pass the list of the plugin types to iterate through on the unpacker/packer plugins though. This would mean an plugin system for plugins???
