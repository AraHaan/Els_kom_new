    + Added where only 1 instance of Els_kom is possible at 1 time.
    + Fixed the unpacking issue in the menu on the Tray.
    + Seems like the 1 instance detection also triggers the TerminateProcess
        function which also terminates all instances (will look for a fix in
        1.3.0.9).
