    + Changed the About Window a lot.
    + Changed some of the Main Window things to.
    + Reverted the bat files like they was in 1.3 state but without the mobs
        and the protected kom files.
    + Fixed the Drive letter problem on the Python27 folder in the bat files.
        It should now be able to find Python installed on any Drive letter that
        isn't "C:\" example what if your Version of Windows is on a Drive
        letter of "E:\" it should now work properly.
