    + Fixed another issue I was trying to fix in a previous version (was in the
        shell icon code).
    + Fixed the issue in 1.3.0.9.
    + Reconstituted some of the TerminateProcess function for when the Option
        in the Menu on the Shell icon is pressed (option did not work in the
        1.3.0.10 code test).
