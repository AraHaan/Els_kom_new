    + Fixed issues in the Tray Icon.
    + Fixed issues with the Testing of mods.
    + Reworked full source since I accidentally used a USB partitioning tool
        inside of Windows for a USB drive and accidentally fucked up this hard
        disc's Master boot file that a Bootable Repartitioning tool fixed by
        Reformatting this drive which in doing so lost the Original Source
        Code. Some things in that Code I wasn't able to find again so I tried
        to put a way of fixing other things also. l0l
