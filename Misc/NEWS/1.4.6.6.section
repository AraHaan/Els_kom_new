    + Fixed the issue in Test mods again that I didn't see before it turns out
        I should have done the enable part on the else part of the if statement
        that checks to see if Elsword is running sorry for that mess.
    + Fixed the Label bug on the part of that Else statement to change it back
        to "". The way it should be done. The only flaw I see still at the
        moment is the tray icon not giving the Els_kom Window Focus like it
        should be doing. The Taskbar icon works on that part though.
