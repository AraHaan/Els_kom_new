- [ ] I have verified and checked that no other crash reports
pertaining to the specific crash detailed in the error logs
exists yet. I also verified that I read every single bit of
detail in the error logs.

Note: Crashes made by 3rd party plugins (plugins not in
this repository or in the Els_kom org.) should be reported
directly to their maintiner(s) to be fixed. We will not
under any circumstances report the issue to them for you.
However if an included plugin did cause the crash we will
fix it based on what this issue details.

**Crash Dump and Dump error log file**
Add the Mini-dump and error log files saved in the
``%LocalAppData%\Els_kom`` folder.

Note: You might need to place these files into an zip file in
order to upload them to this issue. Also only upload the
newest ones pertaining to only this crash, for any other
unresolved crashes that are not reported make a different
issue for each.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

**Patch file**
Optional patch file generated by git that contains changes
to the source code to fix this crash. Because it is
optional the user does not have to do any fixing if they
either do not know how to program, or does not know
where to place the changes.

Note: You might need to place this file into an zip file in
order to upload it to this issue. Alternatively you can make
a dummy commit on your end to a new branch from the branch
you are currently making a change to decribing the actual
change you made and then:

```sh
git format-patch <branch you are targeting the change on>
```

Which generages a single patch file in plain text mode
that was made in git specifically for plain text emails
which can then be copied and pasted here:

```patch
Your patch content here.
```
